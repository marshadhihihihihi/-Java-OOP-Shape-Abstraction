# -Java-OOP-Shape-Abstraction
Java project demonstrating abstraction and polymorphism with shapes.
# Shape Management System (Java OOP - Abstraction)

This is a simple **Java Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** project that demonstrates **abstraction and method overriding** using an **abstract class `Shape`** and its subclasses: `Circle`, `Rectangle`, and `Triangle`.

It allows the user to input shape dimensions and calculates their area using overridden methods. This project is part of my Java learning journey as an IT student.

## ðŸ’¡ Features
- Abstract class `Shape` with an abstract method `calculateArea()`
- Subclasses `Circle`, `Rectangle`, and `Triangle` with:
  - Validation of dimensions
  - Overridden `calculateArea()` and `shapeName()` methods
- User input via console
- Polymorphism (using `Shape` references)
- Clean and structured code with input validation
